# React-Exam


Single-Page Applications are Web apps that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app

we pass data into components by using props. Sharing data between components we lift the state to the higher ancestor.

we use map/filter methods on arrays that could come from a fetch method

observer pattern is used by using state for example. Application share data by lifting their states up to a higher module. 

I have finished the fetcher methods in countryFactory and show them in the CountryTable
